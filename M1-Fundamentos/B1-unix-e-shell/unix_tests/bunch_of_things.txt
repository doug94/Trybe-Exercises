To those who have put their heart and soul into Mozilla products
To those who have seen their good intentions and hard work squandered
To those who knew that change is inevitable, but loss of vision is not
To those who really cared about the user, and cared about usability
To those who trully understood us and desired freedom, but were unheard
To those who were forced to give up the good fight
